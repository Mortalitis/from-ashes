## Usage Notes
- Some factions allow an allied detachment depending on the subfaction. Please refer to the PDF what can be taken as an allied Detachment and select accordingly by clicking "add force" 
- The exception to this is the Devin Pact: Kommodan Loyalists as their Sol Enclaves: Dominion Vassal allies have the Smokescreen ability on top of what Sol Enclaves: Dominion Vassal normally gets. When adding a Detachment keep the main faction as Devin Pact: Kommodan Loyalists and select Sol Enclaves as the subfaction

## Updates
- Split the weapons into two profiles (Weapon Stats and Weapon Accurcay/AP) so that it is presented better within the app and allows PDFs to be exported. Weapon Accuracy/AP profile will have the range bands and then the stats are split between accuract and AP. For example a 6+/2 value means at that range the weapon has 6+ accuracy and an AP of 2
- Fixed some units having Assault Move (3") instead of Assault Move (4")
- Moved points values from the .cat files to the .lib to reduce the workload when updating points

## Current Planned Work
- None
